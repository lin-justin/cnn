# InteLImageNet

My attempt at classifying images from the Intel Image Classification dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification). I developed a Convolutional Neural Network in PyTorch and was able to get an overall test accuracy of 84%.

My InteLImageNet accuracy on the test set:
  * buildings - 82% accuracy
  * forest - 96% accuracy
  * glacier - 79% accuracy
  * mountain - 80% accuracy
  * sea - 85% accuracy
  * street - 84% accuracy
