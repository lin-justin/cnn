# Natural Scene Image Classification

The purpose of this project was to understand how Convolutional Neural Networks work, get familiar with PyTorch, and collecting and processing images.

The data set can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification).

My CNN's accuracy on a third of the test set:
  * buildings - 82% accuracy
  * forest - 96% accuracy
  * glacier - 79% accuracy
  * mountain - 80% accuracy
  * sea - 85% accuracy
  * street - 84% accuracy
